### Test Categories and Structure

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Character Service', () => {
  describe('createCharacter', () => {
    it('should create a valid character', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should validate required fields', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle database errors', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests
```typescript
// API integration test example
describe('Character API', () => {
  it('should create character via API', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/characters')
      .send(validCharacterData)
      .expect(201);
    
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('id');
  });
});
```

#### End-to-End Tests
```typescript
// E2E test example with Playwright
test('complete character creation workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/characters/create');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="name-input"]', 'Test Character');
  await page.selectOption('[data-testid="race-select"]', 'Elf');
  await page.click('[data-testid="create-button"]');
