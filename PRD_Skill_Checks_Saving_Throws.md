## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a player,** I want to quickly roll a skill check so that I can respond to DM prompts without disrupting game flow.

**As a player,** I want to see my skill modifiers clearly so that I know what my character is capable of.

**As a player,** I want the system to automatically calculate my roll results so that I don't make math errors.

**As a player,** I want to apply advantage or disadvantage to my rolls so that I can represent situational modifiers accurately.

**As a DM,** I want to set appropriate DCs for player checks so that I can maintain proper challenge balance.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a player,** I want to see the breakdown of my roll calculation so that I understand how the result was determined.

**As a player,** I want to have keyboard shortcuts for common checks so that I can roll quickly during intense moments.

**As a player,** I want to see critical success animations so that exciting moments feel more impactful.

**As a player,** I want to track my saving throw proficiencies so that I know which saves I'm good at.

**As a DM,** I want to see passive check results so that I can use them in narration without player rolls.
