The project is a web client for a Dungeons and Dragons focused large language model driven game.
The client will be a web application that allows a player to:
- Create a character
- Create the theme of a campaign
- Generate a campaign using a large language model
- Play the campaign
- use the fifth edition D&D ruleset
- use a combination of large language models and rule-based systems to play the campaign
- use an openai compatible endpoint for the large language model
- allow model selection
- create a system prompt for the dungeon master
