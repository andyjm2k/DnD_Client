## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing a real-time chat system that enables live, interactive communication between players and the AI Dungeon Master during campaign gameplay. The system will leverage Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional communication, replacing the current polling-based approach.

## Business Objectives

- Enable real-time communication between players and the AI Dungeon Master
- Support multiplayer campaigns with live chat updates
- Reduce server load by eliminating constant polling
- Provide immediate feedback for player actions and DM responses
- Enhance the immersive gaming experience with instant messaging

## Success Metrics

- **Real-time Latency:** < 500ms response time for chat messages
- **Concurrent Users:** Support up to 10 simultaneous players per campaign
- **Message Reliability:** 99.9% message delivery success rate
- **User Satisfaction:** > 90% user satisfaction with chat responsiveness

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a player,** I want to see other players' messages instantly so that I can participate in real-time conversations during the campaign.

**As a player,** I want to receive immediate DM responses so that the game feels interactive and engaging.

**As a DM (future feature),** I want to communicate with multiple players simultaneously so that I can manage group dynamics effectively.

**As a system administrator,** I want to monitor chat performance so that I can ensure optimal user experience.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a player,** I want to know when other players are typing so that I can expect incoming messages.

**As a player,** I want to see connection status of other participants so that I know who's actively participating.

**As a player,** I want my messages to be delivered reliably even during network issues so that I don't lose important communications.

```

### Data Models

#### Socket Events
```typescript
interface SocketEvents {
  'join:campaign': (campaignId: string) => void;
  'leave:campaign': (campaignId: string) => void;
  'chat:message': (data: ChatMessageData) => void;
  'chat:update': (message: ChatMessage) => void;
  'user:typing': (data: TypingData) => void;
  'user:status': (status: UserStatus) => void;
}
```

#### Message Data Structure
```typescript
interface ChatMessageData {
  campaignId: string;
  message: string;
  type: 'player' | 'dm' | 'system';
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  campaignId: string;
  speaker: string;
  message: string;
  type: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata?: string; // JSON string
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Existing Endpoints (to be enhanced)
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/chat` - Send chat message
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id` - Get campaign with chat history

#### New Real-Time Events
